    The PFA application, "Permission Friendly Apps", allows you to quickly browse
    permissions that you assigned to the applications you have installed.
</p>
<p>
    Permissions are rights of access to services and resources of your phone 
    or tablet. They are classified into two categories by Android: the normal and
    the dangerous one. The danger of a permission means that a malicious use
    could possibly be done particularly with regard to your personal information
    and your wallet.
</p>
<p>
    PFA order all your applications based on the number of permissions
    authorized by weighting more important those defined
    as dangerous by Android.
</p>
<p>
    Three types of applications are distinguished by the following three icons:
<p/>
<p>
    <img src="no_permission" /> means an application that requires no permission.
</p>
<p>
    <img src="normal" /> means an application that contains only "normal" permissions 
    and no "dangerous" permission.
</p>
<p>
    <img src="dangerous" /> means an application that contains one or more "dangerous"
    permissions.
</p>

<p>
    For each application with dangerous permissions you need to ask yourself
    the following questions:
</p>
<p>
    - Do these permissions are justified by the announced use of the application?
</p>
<p>
    - Does the application vendor is trustworthy?
</p>
<p>
    If you have any doubt, it is better to uninstall the application and find a
    equivalent to the Market that seems more serious and requires less permissions.
</p>
<p>
     You can mark trusted applications by selecting the check mark located on the right
     of application's title. The application will appear in the list with the following icon
     <img src="trusted_row" />. You can choose whether to display trusted applications
     using the button in the header bar of the list.
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand, PFA, aims to highlight and encourage applications that
    require no permission. These are usually applications that do not contain
    nor advertising which is another reason to support them.
</p>
<p>
    PFA also lets you filter the list of applications matching a given permission.
    Pressing the button <img src="filter_indicator" /> you can select the
    permission for which you want to list all applications. you can
    change the filter criteria by pressing it.
